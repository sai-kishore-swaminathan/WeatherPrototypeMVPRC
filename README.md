Latest Commit - First Prototype 

What this covers 
- Just the Architecture and connections without any leaks 

Next Steps / Challenges that will make me change the code
- Using Protocols 
- Better UI 
- Better Data Layer

  Plan for now 
- Lets finish Architecture fully, Once Im done we can move step by step covering other areas which challenge me to change the code
- ( Some challengess can mimic what we have in our app so I can refer to it and finish implementing it
For example Using Cell Presenters with builder / Using Generic collection classes / Some programattic UI with autolayout )
